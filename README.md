# cube-engine
an engine for writing LAVAdblogic games

cube-engine uses TurboWarp (www.https://turbowarp.org) for compatibility and ease-of-use, also for modification efforts.

dblogic is the definition of a game that uses the original tile-list engine, and holds the same properties similar to it, such as certain features (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/468464747/) or a modified branch of it

cube-engine version 'beta15' uses dblogic5, which includes ACTOR scripts, properties, propertyThreshold, and much more
